  <h1>Thank you!</h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for picking up a card and taking an interest in Cephid! I'm a musician making
    progressive electronica released my debut album Sparks in the Darkness last year. You can order
    Sparks in the Darkness on vinyl and CD or as a download on
    <a href={BANDCAMP_ALBUM_LINK}>Bandcamp</a>. Alternatively, you can find it on your favourite
    streaming service.

  <p>
    I also produced a remix for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark for their latest album Bauhaus
    Staircase. Physical copies have sold out but you can find the remix on Spotify and streaming
    services everywhere.
