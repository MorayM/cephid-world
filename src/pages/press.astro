  <h2>Press quotes</h2>
  <h3>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Really enjoyed listening to the debut release from Cephid. Great synth sounds and a really
    good video. An artist to watch! - Andy
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Prog Magazine</h3>
  <blockquote>
    This is Jarre 2.0 stuff - gleaming synth lines and infectious beats beaming in from the
    intelligent end of the electro world... great stuff
  </blockquote>
  <h3>The Prog Mind</h3>
  <blockquote>
    [T]he sheer rhythmic and grooving power of this album is so much fun. You need to hear it.
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Devizine</h3>
  <blockquote>
    It has the concept album quality in which you must indulge in it completely... it flows in one
    radical and unique package, impossible to pigeonhole... itâ€™s too groundbreaking to be ignored.
  </blockquote>
