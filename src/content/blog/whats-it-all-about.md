I've always loved electronic music, in whatever form, and that's really informed the two main objectives that I have with Cephid. Firstly, I want to make music that uses forms and song structures that aren't necessarily associated with modern electronic music. Secondly, I didn't want to use a sound palette that could be identified with a particular era or genre, so I didn't want people to be able to say "oh it's a synthwave record" or "it's EDM" or "Berlin school". I wanted to be able to draw on all those palettes (and I think I have done) but I didn't want to be bound to a specific time, place or genre. So two lofty goals, which were very challenging at times, but I hope I've succeeded in getting some of the way there with both of them!
