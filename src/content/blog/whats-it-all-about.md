Welcome to the Cephid blog! This blog (along with my mailing list) is going to the first stop for all news about Cephid, and also home to a few longer-form pieces about the how, why, what and where of Cephid. And mostly because sometimes I just want to read something instead of having to watch a vlog! So to kick things off, I thought I'd write a bit about the "what", namely what I want Cephid to be.

Everything about Cephid comes back to my love of all kinds of electronic music. From my first exposure to the really classic stuff like Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis, right up to the modern day. Despite this, I've always been a little dissatisfied with a lot of the electronic music that I listen to, and when I decided that Cephid was going to be "a thing", I came up with two objectives for all the music that would be released under this name.

Firstly, I want to make music that uses forms and structures that aren't necessarily associated with modern electronic music. I wanted to surprise the listener wherever possible, so they're never sure quite where the music will go next. A lot of this was inspired by classical music, but also from progressive rock - my other love!

The second objective I had was that I didn't want to limit myself to one particular sound palette. A lot of electronic music genres are linked to particular families of sounds - for example synthwave uses a very specific set of sounds, as does trance, as do so many others. I wanted to make music that couldn't be easily pigeonholed, and I wanted to be able to pick and choose elements any genre that took my fancy, so long as it suited the music. As it turns out, that makes promoting an album much more complicated, but still, I wanted it to stand on its own without any label!

Both of these turned out to be very lofty goals and really challenging to work with at times, but I hope I've succeeded in getting even part of the way there with each of them. And yes, when you hear the album, hopefully you'll be able to judge me on that for yourselves!
