I'm very excited to announce that you can now watch the full trailer for Worlds Before on YouTube! As the first single from Sparks in the Darkness, and the first Cephid music that the world will hear, I wanted to make an impact with it, visually as well as sonically.

The full track will be out on all good streaming services, and the full video will be released on YouTube on 27th November so make sure you tune in. Yes, I hear you heckling at the back, there are no "good" streaming services from a musician's point of view but they are a necessary evil in this day an age, and they do have their uses as promotional tools.

To that end, I would be incredibly grateful if you can help out with this debut release in two ways. Firstly, if you like what you hear from the trailer, and know someone else who might *also* like what you hear, please tell them about it! Word of mouth is the best publicity - I've lost track of the amount of good music I've discovered from friends. Secondly, if you are a Spotify user, please go [here](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/cephid/worlds-before-1st-spark), scroll down, click on "Spotify Pre-save" and follow the instructions. It may not seem like much, but it helps gives me a boost up the Spotify rankings on release day, and in the streaming game, every little helps!

Thank you all so much for your support, you are all hugely appreciated! ðŸ˜Š
